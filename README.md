## Getting Started

1. Choose the project you're interested in
2. Navigate to the respective folder
3. Follow the setup instructions in the project's README
4. Run the examples to see the frameworks in action

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Ollama (for both LangChain and LangGraph examples)
- Git

**Recommended:** Use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts:
```bash
python -m venv ai_examples_env
# Windows: ai_examples_env\Scripts\activate
# Mac/Linux: source ai_examples_env/bin/activate
```

## Quick Start

For the LangChain project:

```bash
# Navigate to the langchain directory
cd langchain

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Make sure Ollama is running and has llama3.2:latest
ollama pull llama3.2:latest

# Run a simple example
python simple_chat.py
```

For the LangGraph project:

```bash
# Navigate to the langgraph directory
cd langgraph

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Make sure Ollama is running and has llama3.2:latest
ollama pull llama3.2:latest

# Run a workflow example
python simple_agent.py
```

## Testing

This repository includes comprehensive testing and CI/CD:

### Local Testing
```bash
# Test dependencies and basic functionality
python test_dependencies.py

# Run CI-style tests (syntax, imports, structure)
python ci_test.py

# Validate all example files
python validate_examples.py
```

### Automated Testing
- **CI Tests**: Automated testing on every push/PR across Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11
- **Quick Status Check**: Fast validation for basic functionality
- **Health Check**: Weekly dependency and compatibility monitoring
