## Getting Started

1. Choose the project you're interested in
2. Navigate to the respective folder
3. Follow the setup instructions in the project's README
4. Run the examples to see the frameworks in action

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Ollama (for LangChain examples)
- Git

## Quick Start

For the LangChain project:

```bash
# Navigate to the langchain directory
cd langchain

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Make sure Ollama is running and has llama3.2:latest
ollama pull llama3.2:latest

# Run a simple example
python simple_chat.py
```

For the LangGraph project:

```bash
# Navigate to the langgraph directory
cd langgraph

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Make sure Ollama is running and has llama3.2:latest
ollama pull llama3.2:latest

# Run a workflow example
python simple_agent.py
```
